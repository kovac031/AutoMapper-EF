> Practicing with WebAPI and MVC projects

## Project WebAPI
- new simple database, one "Students" table
- CRUD and mapping using AutoMapper
- filtering, sorting, paging using LINQ for practice

## Postman screenshot for just because
Showing filtering:

## Project MVC
- same as for WebAPI except:
  - is MVC, so has Views and View models
  - controller code slightly different
  - paging, sorting, filtering approach different
 
## It's not pretty but it works
Can set a lot of parameters and nothing gets dropped while paging, sorting, filtering
